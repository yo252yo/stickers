# Yoann sticker chrome extension

## What is it

This is a chrome extension that will suggest stickers (gifs, images, etc...) from anywhere you may type in chrome. The plus side is that it's compatible with all kind of messenging webapps (facebook, discord, etc...). The minus side is that it looks at everything you're typing on chrome. It doesn't store anything, much less send anything online, please verify for yourself in the code, but let me reiterate IT DOES LOOK AT EVERYTHING YOU TYPE. Therefore, I only recommend it for experts only and I won't publish it on the chrome extension store.

## How do I install it?

You download this as a zip, unzip it, look at your chrome extensions and tell it "load unpacked" and TADA it works.

## How does it work?

### Setup

It is centered around 3 concepts:

- stickers, which are any image media, represented by their URL
- trigger words, the words that are going to trigger the appearance of the sticker
- keywords, a kind of generic trigger word. For instance you might have the keyword "sad" to encompass all the trigger words "cry", "sad", ":(", etc...


Therefore this extension requires two CSVs. One that defines the mapping between keywords and trigger words:
Example: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTIxCFi4KCY6IvBPoHJJBu1KtPoHiZGQPChPHqzpfg0YxzM4BaKSBoFFoGf09kmVkhLsQ6vbLEsKBbJ/pub?gid=0&single=true&output=csv

And one that defines the mapping between stickers and words (trigger or keywords) that correspond:
Example: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTIxCFi4KCY6IvBPoHJJBu1KtPoHiZGQPChPHqzpfg0YxzM4BaKSBoFFoGf09kmVkhLsQ6vbLEsKBbJ/pub?gid=2145090485&single=true&output=csv

Both of these are hosted on Google Spreadsheet, which is, at least currently, a pretty nice backend for this kind of storage:

You can provide your own CSVs in the options of the extension.

### Usage

Every time you type one of your keywords, delimited by a space or punctuation, a little screen will appear suggesting stickers you could use. You can ignore it and keep typing, or click on a sticker to copy it to your clipboard. I've also setup a keyboard shortcut to be able to use it without mouse but tbh i've never used it so i'm not sure you'll ever do it either xD
